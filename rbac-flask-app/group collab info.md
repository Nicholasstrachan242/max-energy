# MAXX ENERGY RBAC System – Integration & Implementation Notes

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database access
- **Flask-WTF**: Form handling and CSRF protection
- **Werkzeug**: Password hashing utilities
- **MySQL**: (for group project) or SQLite (for local dev)
- **Jinja2**: Templating engine
- **Flask-Session**: (optional, for advanced session management)
- **python-dotenv**: (optional, for environment variable management)

## RBAC System Implementation in Maxx Energy
- **Models**: User, Role, Permission (with many-to-many relationships)
- **Authentication**: Secure login/logout, password hashing
- **Authorization**: Role-based decorators and permission checks
- **Admin Interface**: Manage users, roles, and permissions via web UI
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Menus and dashboard features shown/hidden based on user role/permissions
- **Security**: CSRF protection, session security, SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Seeded Users/Roles**: Default users for each role (admin, executive, manager, staff, guest)

## How to Integrate RBAC into Another Group Project (MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Python)

### 1. Understand the Core Components
- Flask app structure (routes, templates, static files)
- Database models: User, Role, Permission
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Role/permission management UI

### 2. Identify the Target Project’s Database
- Confirm the use of MySQL and SQLAlchemy
- Check for existing User model or authentication system

### 3. Integrate the Models
- Copy User, Role, and Permission models into the group project’s models file
- Merge with existing User model if needed (add role_id, password methods, etc.)
- Ensure SQLAlchemy `db` object is initialized

### 4. Migrate the Database
- Run `db.create_all()` or use Flask-Migrate/Alembic to create new tables in MySQL
- If using Alembic, generate and apply a migration for the new models

### 5. Integrate the Logic
- Copy authentication, login, logout, and role/permission management routes into the group project’s Flask app
- Update import paths and references as needed
- Include decorators (like `@admin_required`) and session logic

### 6. Integrate the Templates
- Copy templates (`login.html`, `dashboard.html`, `role_management.html`, etc.) into the group project’s `templates` folder
- Adjust template inheritance and navigation to match the group project’s layout

### 7. Update Configuration
- Add security and session config to the group project’s `app.config`
- Set up environment variables for secrets and database URI as needed

### 8. Test the Integration
- Create test users and roles in the new database
- Log in as different roles and verify permissions and access control
- Check that the UI and navigation adapt to the new project’s style

### 9. Collaborate with Your Team
- Communicate about new models and routes
- Document any changes or new requirements for using the RBAC system
- Ensure everyone knows how to manage users, roles, and permissions

### 10. Example Table
| Step | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| 1    | Copy/merge models (`User`, `Role`, `Permission`) |
| 2    | Migrate database (create new tables/fields)      |
| 3    | Copy/merge routes and logic                      |
| 4    | Copy/merge templates and static files            |
| 5    | Update app config and environment variables      |
| 6    | Test all features and permissions                |
| 7    | Document for your team                           |

**If you want to use environment variables for secrets and database URI, use `python-dotenv` and a `.env` file.**
