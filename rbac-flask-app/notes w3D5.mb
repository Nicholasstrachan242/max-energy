# MAXX ENERGY RBAC System â€“ Session Summary (W3D5)

## 1. Features & Functionality Added/Updated

- **User Management Button:**
  - Added a prominent orange "User Management" button for admins on the role management page.

- **Custom Password Reset:**
  - Admins can reset any user's password (except the admin account) via a secure form.
  - Minimum password length for reset is now **13 characters**.
  - The reset form and validation messages have been updated accordingly.

- **CSRF Protection Fixes:**
  - All forms (including login, admin re-auth, and password reset) now include a hidden CSRF token input, ensuring Flask-WTF protection works correctly.
  - Fixed issues where CSRF tokens were missing or not in the correct format.

- **Audit Logging:**
  - Added an `AuditLog` model to the database.
  - Logs all key admin actions:  
    - Admin authentication for user management  
    - User creation, deletion, password reset, status changes  
    - Role creation, editing, deletion
  - Recent audit logs are displayed at the bottom of the user management and role management pages.

- **Admin Dashboard Button:**
  - Added a "Dashboard" button for admins at the top of the user management page for easy rerouting.

## 2. Database Changes

- **New Table:**
  - `AuditLog` table tracks admin actions with fields:  
    - `id`, `admin_username`, `action`, `target`, `details`, `timestamp`
- **User, Role, and Permission Models:**
  - No structural changes today, but seeded users/roles/permissions remain as before.

## 3. Login & Key Information

- **Default Admin Credentials:**
  - **Username:** `admin`  
  - **Password:** `password`  
  - (Change this password in production for security!)

- **Admin Re-Authentication:**
  - To access user management, admins must re-authenticate using the above credentials.

- **CSRF Protection:**
  - All forms require a valid CSRF token.  
  - If you restart the server, use a fixed `SECRET_KEY` in development to avoid invalidating tokens.

- **Password Policy:**
  - When resetting a user's password, the new password must be at least **13 characters**.

## 4. Security & Best Practices

- **CSRF tokens** are now correctly included in all forms.
- **Audit logs** provide traceability for all admin actions.
- **Session management** and admin-only access are enforced for sensitive routes.
- **Do not use the default admin password in production.** Change it immediately after setup.
